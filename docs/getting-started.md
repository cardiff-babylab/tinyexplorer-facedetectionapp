# Getting Started

Welcome to the TinyExplorer FaceDetectionApp user guide. This section helps you install the application and become familiar with the interface.

## Installation

Choose your operating system below for specific installation instructions:

=== "macOS"

    ### macOS Installation Guide
    
    Since TinyExplorer FaceDetectionApp is not signed with an Apple Developer certificate, macOS requires additional steps to ensure the app can run safely on your system.
    
    #### Step 1: Download the Application
    1. Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/cardiff-babylab/tinyexplorer-facedetectionapp/releases)
    2. Download the latest `.dmg` file for macOS
    3. Open the downloaded `.dmg` file
    4. Drag **TinyExplorer FaceDetectionApp** to your **Applications** folder
    
    #### Step 2: Remove Quarantine (Required)
    
    !!! info "Why is this necessary?"
        macOS quarantines unsigned applications downloaded from the internet for security. Since we don't have an Apple Developer certificate (which costs $99/year), you need to manually approve the app. This is safe as long as you downloaded it from our official GitHub releases.
    
    1. Open **Terminal** (found in Applications → Utilities)
    2. Type the following command but **don't press Enter yet**:
       ```bash
       sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine 
       ```
    3. Add a space after the command
    4. **Drag and drop** the TinyExplorer app from your Applications folder into the Terminal window
       - This will automatically add the correct path to your app
       - The complete command should look like:
         ```bash
         sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/TinyExplorer\ FaceDetectionApp.app
         ```
    5. Press **Enter** and type your Mac password when prompted
    
    !!! tip "What does this command do?"
        - `sudo` - Runs the command with administrator privileges
        - `xattr` - Modifies file attributes
        - `-r` - Applies recursively to all files in the app
        - `-d com.apple.quarantine` - Removes the quarantine flag
        - The path points to your installed application
    
    #### Step 3: Launch the Application
    1. Go to your **Applications** folder
    2. Double-click **TinyExplorer FaceDetectionApp**
    3. If you see a security warning, click **Open** to proceed
    4. The app will now launch successfully!
    
    !!! success "Installation Complete!"
        The app is now installed and ready to use. You only need to do this once.
