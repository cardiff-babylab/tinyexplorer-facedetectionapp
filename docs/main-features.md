# Main Features

## File and Folder Selection
- Browse and select individual image or video files
- Browse and select entire folders containing multiple images and videos

## Model Selection
Choose from multiple face detection models:

- **YOLOv8n-face (Nano):** fastest inference, smallest size (~2.7 MB); lower accuracy; ideal for real‑time or limited resources.
- **YOLOv8m-face (Medium):** balanced speed and accuracy (~27.3 MB); solid default for most tasks.
- **YOLOv8l-face (Large):** highest accuracy within v8 (~59.2 MB); slower inference; best for high precision.
- **YOLOv11m-face (Medium):** newer generation with improved accuracy/speed trade‑offs; good general‑purpose choice on modern hardware.
- **YOLOv11l-face (Large):** higher accuracy variant; increased compute and memory cost.
- **YOLOv12l-face (Large):** latest large model; highest accuracy and resource use; recommended for offline batch processing.
- **RetinaFace:** alternative architecture with facial landmarks; good speed/accuracy for feature localization. Note: available on Apple Silicon (arm64) macOS only. Source: [serengil/retinaface](https://github.com/serengil/retinaface).

The app automatically downloads required model weights when needed.
